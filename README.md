# 1. Systems

## 1.1 Systems and Complexity

### 1.1.1 Common problems of systems in many fields

- Emergent properties
- Propagation of effects
- Incommensurate scaling
- Trade-offs

### 1.1.2 Systems, Components, Interfaces, and Environments

- A system is a set on interconnected components that has an expected behavior observed at the interface with its environment.

### 1.1.3 Complexity

- Large number of components
- Large number of interconnections
- Many irregularities
- A long description
- A team of designers, implementers, or maintainers

## 1.2 Sources of Complexity

### 1.2.1 Cascading and interacting requirements

- *Principle of escalating complexity*

**Adding a requirement increases complexity out of proportion**
